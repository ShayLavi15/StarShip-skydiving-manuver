# StarShip-skydiving-manuver
Mods needed:
- tundra exploration
- kOS
- Trajectories

How to use:
- Use the craft file (The fins are named so you can only use this craft)
- Pick a target to land on on map
- set trajectory decent profile to 90 AoA at low and ground hights!

Have fun!

Please credit me if you're planning on makeing a video using my script! I worked hard on this.
